<p>Configuration files are similar for <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/configure/server.html">server</a> and <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/configure/client.html">client</a>.</p>
<p>They are in a typical setting = value format and # are used for comments.</p>
<p>We have to define to connetion settings to the middleware, the settings for the chosen security plugins, the facts source and other general settings.</p>
<p>The setup of the whole infrastructure involves some parameters to be consistent on the mcollective config files and the message broker ones (credentials and eventually certificates).</p>
<p>There can be different setups, according to the security plugins used, the recommended one is well described in the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/deploy/standard.html">Standard Mcollective Deployment</a></p>
