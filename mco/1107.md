<p>Some distros provide native mcollective packages but it's definitively recommended to use <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html">PuppetLabs repositories</a> to have recent mcollective versions and packages for the needed dependencies.</p>
<p>On the nodes to be managed just install the <strong>mcollective</strong> package, it's configuration file is <strong>/etc/mcollective/server.cfg</strong></p>
<p>On the administrative nodes, from where to control the infrastructure, install the <strong>mcollective-client</strong> package, it's configuration file is <strong>/etc/mcollective/client.cfg</strong></p>
<p>On both clients and servers we have to install the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/deploy/plugins.html">agent plugins</a></p>
<p>On the middleware server(s) install <strong>activemq</strong> or <strong>rabbitmq</strong></p>
