<p><abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> environments allow isolation of <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> code and data: for each environment we can have different paths manifest files, Hiera data and modules.</p>
<p><abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr>'s environments DO NOT necessarily have to match the operational environments of our servers.</p>
<p>Environments mamanagement has changed from <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> 3.6 onwards:</p>
<p>Earlier versions were based on so-called <strong>Config file Environments</strong> where each environment had to be defined in <strong>puppet.conf</strong>.</p>
<p>From 3.6 <strong>directory environments</strong> have been introduced and the older approach has been deprecated.</p>
<p>On <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> 4.x only directory environments are supported.</p>
