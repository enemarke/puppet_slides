<p>Execute <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> on the client</p>
<p>Client shell # puppet agent -t</p>
<p>If pluginsync = true (default from <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> 3.0) the client retrieves all extra plugins (facts, types and providers) present in modules on the server's $modulepath</p>
<p>Client output # Info: Retrieving plugin</p>
<p>The client runs facter and send its facts to the server</p>
<p>Client output # Info: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/... [...]</p>
<p>The server looks for the client's hostname (or certname, if different from the hostname) and looks into its nodes list</p>
<p>The server compiles the catalog for the client using also client's facts</p>
<p>Server's logs # Compiled catalog for in environment production in 8.22 seconds</p>
<p>If there are not syntax errors in the processed <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> code, the server sends the catalog to the client, in PSON format.</p>
