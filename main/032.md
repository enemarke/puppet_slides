<h2>Masterless - puppet apply</h2>
<p>Our <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> code (written in manifests) is applied directly on the target system.</p>

<p>And we have one or more Masters where <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> server runs as a service</p>
<p>Client/Server communication is via https (<strong>port 8140</strong>)</p>
<p>Clients certificates have to be accepted (<strong>signed</strong>) on the Master</p>
