<h1>Managing files</h1>       
                            
<p>Files are the most configured resources on a system, we manage them with the <strong>file</strong> type:</p> 

    @@@ puppet
    file { 'httpd.conf':
        # (namevar) The file path
        path      => '/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf',  
        # Define the file type and if it should exist:
        # 'present','absent','directory','link'
        ensure    => 'present',
        # Url from where to retrieve the file content
        source    => 'puppet://[puppetfileserver]/<share>/path',
        # Actual content of the file, alternative to source
        # Typically it contains a reference to the template function
        content   => 'My content',
        # Typical file's attributes
        owner     => 'root',
        group     => 'root',
        mode      => '0644',
        # The sylink target, when ensure => link
        target    => '/etc/httpd/httpd.conf',
        # Whether to recursively manage a directory (when ensure => directory)
        recurse   => true,
    }
