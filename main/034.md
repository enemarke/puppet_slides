<p>A <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> server (running as 'puppet') listening on 8140 on the <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> Master (the server )</p>
<p>A <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> client (running as 'root') on each managed node</p>
<p>Client can be run as a service (default), via cron (with random delays), manually or via MCollective</p>
<p>Client and Server have to share SSL certificates. New client certificates must be signed by the Master CA</p>
<p>It's possible to enable automatic clients certificates signing on the Master (be aware of security concerns)</p>
