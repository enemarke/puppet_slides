When we have to use a class previously defined, we <strong>declare</strong> it.
This can be done in 2 different ways:
Class declaration, without parameters: 

    require mysql
    contain mysql

(Inside a catalog we can have multiple contains of the same class but that class it's applied only once.)
 
class declaration with explicit parameters: 

    class { 'mysql':
      root_password => 'my_value',
      port          => '3307',
    }

(Syntax is the same of normal resources and the same class can be declared, in this way, only once inside the same catalog)
