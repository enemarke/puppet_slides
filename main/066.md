<p><abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> provides different constructs to manage conditionals inside manifests:</p>
<p><strong>Selectors</strong> allows to set the value of a variable or an argument inside a resource declaration according to the value of another variable.<br />Selectors therefore just returns values and are not used to manage conditionally entire blocks of code.</p>
<p><strong>case statements</strong> are used to execute different blocks of code according to the values of a variable. It's possible to have a default block for unmatched entries.<br />Case statements are NOT used inside resource declarations.</p>
<p><strong>if elsif else</strong> conditionals, like case, are used to execute different blocks of code and can't be used inside resources declarations.<br />We can can use any of <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr>'s comparison expressions and we can combine more than one for complex patterns matching.</p>
<p><strong>unless</strong> is somehow the opposite of <strong>if</strong>. It evaluates a boolean condition and if it's <em>false</em> it executes a block of code. It doesn't have elsif / else clauses.</p>
