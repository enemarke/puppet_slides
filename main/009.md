<p>When clients connect, the <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> Master generates a <strong>catalog</strong> with the list of of the resources that clients have to apply locally.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> Master has to <em>classify</em> nodes and define for each of them:</p>
<p>The <strong>classes</strong> to include<br /> The <strong>parameters</strong> to pass<br /> The <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> <strong>environment</strong> to use</p>
<p>The <strong>catalog</strong> is generated by the Master according to the logic of our <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> code and data.</p>
<p>In our code we can define our <strong>variables</strong> and use other ones that may come from different sources:</p>
<p><strong>facts</strong> generated directly by the client<br /> <strong>parameters</strong> obtained from node's classification<br /> <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> <strong>internal</strong> variables</p>
