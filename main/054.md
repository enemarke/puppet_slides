<p><abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> language as an official <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/style_guide.html">Style Guide</a> which defines recommended rules on how to write the code.</p>
<p>The standard de facto tool to check the code style is <a href="http://puppet-lint.com/">puppet-lint</a>.</p>
<p>Badly formatted example:</p> 

    @@@ puppet
    file {
     "/etc/issue":
         content => "Welcome to $fqdn",
         ensure => present,
          mode => 644,
         group => "root",
         path => "${issue_file_path}",
         }
    
Corrected style:

    @@@ puppet
    file { '/etc/issue':
      ensure  => present,
      content => "Welcome to ${fqdn}",
      mode    => '0644',
      group   => 'root',
      path    => $issue_file_path,
    }
