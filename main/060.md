# Class inheritance #

In Puppet classes are just containers of resources and have nothing to do with OOP classes. Therefore the meaning of class inheritance is somehow limited to few specific cases.

When using class inheritance, the main class ('puppet' in the sample below) is always evaluated first and all the variables and resource defaults it sets are available in the scope of the child class ('puppet::server').

Moreover the child class can override the arguments of a resource defined in the main class. Note the syntax used when referring to the existing resource File['/etc/puppet/puppet.conf']:

    @@@ puppet
    class puppet {
      file { '/etc/puppet/puppet.conf':
        content => template('puppet/client/puppet.conf'),
      }
    }
    
    class puppet::server inherits puppet {
      File['/etc/puppet/puppet.conf'] {
        content => template('puppet/server/puppet.conf'),
      }
    }
