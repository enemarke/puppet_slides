<p><abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> language is declarative and not procedural: it defines states, the order in which resources are written in manifests does not affect the order in which they are applied to the desired state.</p>
<p>To manage resources ordering, there are 3 different methods, which can cohexist:</p>
<p>1 - Use the metaparameters <strong>before</strong>, <strong>require</strong>, <strong>notify</strong>, <strong>subscribe</strong></p>
<p>2 - Use the <strong>Chaining arrows</strong> (compared to the above metaparamers: <strong>-&gt;</strong> , <strong>&lt;-</strong> , <strong>&lt;~</strong> , <strong>~&gt;</strong>)</p>
<p>3 - Use run stages</p>
