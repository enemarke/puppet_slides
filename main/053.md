# Managing users #

Puppet has native types to manage users and groups, allowing easy addition, modification and removal. Here are the main arguments of the user type:

    @@@ puppet
    user { 'joe':
        # (namevar) The user name
        name      => 'joe',  
        # The user's status: 'present','absent','role'
        ensure    => 'present',
        # The user's  id
        uid       => '1001',
        # The user's primary group id
        gid       => '1001',
        # Eventual user's secondary groups (use array for many)
        groups    => [ 'admins' , 'developers' ],
        # The user's password. As it appears in /etc/shadow
        # Use single quotes to avoid unanted evaluation of $* as variables
        password  => '$6$ZFS5JFFRZc$FFDSvPZSSFGVdXDlHe',
        # Typical users' attributes
        shell     => '/bin/bash',
        home      => '/home/joe',
        mode      => '0644',
    }
