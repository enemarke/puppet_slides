# Managing dependencies - before | notify #

In a typical Package/Service/Configuration file example we want the package to be installed first, configure it and then start the service, eventually managing its restart if the config file changes.

This can be expressed with metaparameters:
 
    @@@ puppet
    package { 'exim':
      before => File['exim.conf'],  
    }
    
    file { 'exim.conf':
      notify => Service['exim'],
    }
    
    service { 'exim':
    }


which is equivalent to

    @@@ puppet
    Package['exim'] -> File['exim.conf'] ~> Service['exim']
