<p>On the PuppetMaster we can define with the <strong>node</strong> definition the resources to apply to any node.</p>
<p>It is possible to have an inheritance structure for nodes, so that resources defined for a node are automatically included in an inheriting node.</p>
<p>An example:</p> 
<pre class=" code"><code><span class="java_plain">node&nbsp;</span><span class="java_literal">'general'</span><span class="java_plain">&nbsp;</span><span class="java_separator">{</span><span class="java_plain">&nbsp;</span><span class="java_separator">...</span><span class="java_plain">&nbsp;</span><span class="java_separator">}</span><span class="java_plain"></span>
<span class="java_plain"></span>
<span class="java_plain">node&nbsp;</span><span class="java_literal">'www01'</span><span class="java_plain">&nbsp;inherits&nbsp;general&nbsp;</span><span class="java_separator">{</span><span class="java_plain">&nbsp;</span><span class="java_separator">...</span><span class="java_plain">&nbsp;</span><span class="java_separator">}</span><span class="java_plain"></span></code></pre>
<p>In <abbr title="Puppet automation tool">Puppet</abbr> versions prior to 3, it was possible to use nodes inheritance also to set variables and override them at different inheritance levels, and refer to these variables with their &quot;short&quot; name (not fully qualified).<br />When using this approach it was important to avoid the inclusion on classes in the inheritance tree, since some variables could be evaluated in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>This is no more possible because variables are not more dynamically scoped, and generally speaking nodes inheritance has been deprecated.</p>
